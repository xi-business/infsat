(* This shows the limitations of 0-CFA - it detects (a, I) flowing into x in N
and y from A that can be either e or ae flowing into y. This gives four
combinations of (x,y), even though only two are possible in this scenario.
This happens when the grammar features partial application of a nonterminal
and a variable used in its last argument at the same time. *)
Grammar.
S -> t (Na e) (Ni (a e)).
A x y -> x y.
Na x -> A (N a) x.
Ni x -> A (N I) x.
N x y -> x y.
I x -> x.
End.
